## Why Diana

Most AI assistants forget you the second the tab closes. You re-explain your stack, re-paste your code, re-tell the same story about that one bug — every single session.

**Diana doesn't.**

She remembers your projects, your decisions, your style — and picks up exactly where you left off. Less context-rebuilding. More building.

---

## What She Does

| | |
|---|---|
| **Persistent Memory** | Retains context across sessions — no more déjà vu conversations |
| **Context-Aware Chat** | Conversations build on real history, not a blank slate |
| **Coding Assistant** | Debugs, reviews, explains, and architects alongside you |
| **Project Guidance** | Helps plan, choose tech, and stay on the best path forward |
| **Built to Scale** | Distributed architecture designed for real growth |

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hjeandedieu/diana.git
cd diana
```

**One-command launch (recommended):**

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

**Or run each service manually:**

```bash
# Frontend
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev

# Backend
cd backend && npm install && npm run dev

# AI Service
cd ai-service && pip install -r requirements.txt && uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

> Requires Node.js 20+, Python 3.11+, PostgreSQL (or Docker to skip all that).

Set up your `.env` files with `DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, and `OPENAI_API_KEY` before launch.

## What's Next

- Semantic memory retrieval & long-term consolidation
- Repository & codebase understanding
- Voice + real-time streaming conversations
- Mobile app, browser extension, IDE integrations

## About This Project

Diana was built solo by **RedBlue** for the **Stardance Challenge**, with AI tools assisting along the way — for research, debugging support, and documentation. Every architectural decision, line of integrated code, and final feature was directed, reviewed, and shipped by the developer.
